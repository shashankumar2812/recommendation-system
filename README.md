### Module code

We place the module code in a file called `recommendationsystem.py` in directory called
`recommendationsystem`. In an interactive Python session, the classes and functions defined inside of the
`recommendationsystem.py` file are available in the `rs` namespace by typing following:

 `import recommendationsystem as rs`
